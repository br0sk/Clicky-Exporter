This is a php script that will fetch data from a site on an account 
in www.getclicky.com.

I created it since there is no full export feature in Clikcy. The API only
allows for fetching 5000 records in one go. This script addresses this problem
and paginates the results and downloads the data in XML format.

This is useful if you want to have the raw website statistical data for 
analysis in a 3d party product that support import of XML files.

The script is intended to run on PHP 5.3.x on windows and it need to have the
curl module activated.
